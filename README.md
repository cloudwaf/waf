Under DDoS Attack? The CloudWAF Difference
Under DDoS Attack? We Can Protect You in an Emergency. Freewaf's CloudWAF mitigates DDoS attacks, including those that target UDP and ICMP protocols, SYN/ACK, DNS and NTP amplification and Layer 7 attacks. Our global network has defended against sustained attacks over 200Gbps. If you're under DDoS attack, we can get your site back online within minutes.

Freewaf's CloudWAF enterprise-class web application firewall (WAF) protects your Internet property from common vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and cross-site forgery requests with no changes to your existing infrastructure.

Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are on the rise and have evolved into complex and overwhelming security challenges for organizations large and small. Although DoS attacks are not a recent phenomenon, the methods and resources available to conduct and mask such attacks have dramatically evolved to include distributed (DDoS) and, more recently, distributed reflector (DRDoS) attacks—attacks that simply cannot be addressed by traditional on-premise solutions.

Freewaf's CloudWAF advanced DDoS protection, provisioned as a service at the network edge, matches the sophistication and scale of such threats, and can be used to mitigate DDoS attacks of all forms and sizes including those that target the UDP and ICMP protocols, as well as SYN/ACK, DNS amplification and Layer 7 attacks.

Freewaf's CloudWAF is one of the largest DDoS protection networks in the world. We offer flat-rate DDoS protection based on Anycast technology and have successfully mitigated attacks bigger than 200Gbps.

Freewaf's Cloud Web Application Firewall
Freewaf's CloudWAF enterprise-class web application firewall (WAF) protects your Internet property from common vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and cross-site forgery requests with no changes to your existing infrastructure.

CloudWAF sees roughly 0.2 million requests every second, and our WAF is continually identifying and blocking new potential threats. If you’re using a web application firewall that doesn’t leverage the collective intelligence of other web properties, you need to supply all your own WAF rules from scratch, which means you need to monitor the entire Internet security landscape on your own.

When one customer requests a new custom WAF rule, we analyze whether it applies to all 5.5 million domains on our network. If it does, we automatically apply that rule to everybody on our network. The more web properties on our network, the stronger our WAF gets, and the safer the Cloudwaf community becomes.
